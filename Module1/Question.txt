1. Autonomously move the robot along the perimeter of a square path of dimension 0.5 m x 0.5 m.
If the robot senses an obstacle within 25cm on its way then it must stop, rotate by 180 degrees and 
trace the path along the other direction. Store the path trace into a file. 
  
Expected output: Create a folder named Module 3. The path trace should be saved into a file named as  
problem1_pathtrace.csv. The path trace should include 3 columns in each row: index or row number,
wheel encoder value, distance value from distance sensor. The path trace must be collected at 
at-the-least 2 samples/second.


Bonus (2pts): The entire episode must be streamed using the remote camera option.
