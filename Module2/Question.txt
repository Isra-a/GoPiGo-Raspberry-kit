1. Autonomously move the robot along the perimeter of a square path of 
dimension 0.5 m x 0.5 m. If the robot senses an obstacle within 25cm on its 
way then it must stop, rotate by 180 degrees and trace the path along the 
other direction. Store the path trace into a file. 
  
Expected output: Create a folder named Module 3. The path trace should be 
saved into a file named as  problem1_pathtrace.csv. The path trace should 
include 3 columns in each row: index or row number, wheel encoder value, 
distance value from distance sensor. The path trace must be collected at 
at-the-least 2 samples/second.

2.  Autonomously move the robot forward along the four cardinal directions. 
The path will be: turn towards North-->move 50cm--> turn towards East>move 
50cm→ turn towards South→ move 50cm-->turn towards West-->move 50cm-->turn 
towards North and REPEAT. If it detects an obstacle within 25cm along the 
path it MUST AVOID THE OBSTACLE and MOVE IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION SO AS TO NOT
 HIT THE OBSTACLE. Store the path trace into a file.		

Expected output: Save the path trace as problem2_pathtrace.csv in the 
Module 3 folder. The path trace should include 4 columns in each row: 
index or row number, wheel encoder value, distance value from distance 
sensor, tracing path direction. The path trace must be collected at 
at-the-least 2 samples/second.
